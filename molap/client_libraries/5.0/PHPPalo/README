configure

Run configure --help to see a list of options
Special options for PHPPalo are:

--enable-ZTS :
When this switch is used ZTS=1 is passed to the compiler, enabling PHP Zend Thread Safety

--enable-debug=[yes/no]
Add debugging symbols and do not optimize, use GDB debugging.

PHPHEADERS 
This variable is passed to configure. 
Its value is the path to the PHP sources on this system. 
The default value for this is ./PHP. (e.g. a symbolic link)

example:
PHPHEADERS=/usr/src/php/php4/php-4.4.4 ./configure --enable-debug=yes

configure with ZTS=0 and the above path to PHP sources.

Hint:
Use "make distclean" for a fresh restart.
Use "autoreconf -v -f -i" in emergencies, and if you know what you are doing.

if autoreconf -v -f -i doesn't work try the next four lines
libtoolize --force --copy
aclocal
autoconf
automake
