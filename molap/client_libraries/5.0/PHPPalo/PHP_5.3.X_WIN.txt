i)
Since config.w32.h is missing from the source tree from PHP 5.3.0 on (PHP BUG),
you have to copy config.w32.h from PHP_5.3.X_WIN_Support (depending from the php binaries you use)
to the 'main' subdirectory of the php source tree.

ii)
you have to change TSRM\tsrm_config_common.h  in your php-5.3.x source tree.

replace the line

# if WINNT|WIN32

by

# if defined(WINNT)|| defined(WIN32)|| defined(WIN64)
