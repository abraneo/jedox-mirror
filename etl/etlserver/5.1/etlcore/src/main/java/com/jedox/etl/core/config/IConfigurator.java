/**
 * Interface for the common functionality of all Configurators. 
 * A configurator is responsible to provide the translation from a XML-configuration of a {@link com.jedox.etl.core.component.IComponent Component} to data-structures understood by the component in its initialization phase.
 * In this phase a Component is intended to configure itself by its {@link com.jedox.etl.core.component.IComponent#init()} method with the help of its configurator. The component is not intended to directly access the XML structures.
 * Thus the configurator should encapsulate all XML-processing and expose suitable data-structures to the component. Whenever changes in the XML syntax are made, the configurator should cope with them making them transparent for the component.
 * <p>
 * Another key task of the configurator is the resolving of variables from the XML-configuration to context sensitive values. The default value of a variable is declared in the <variables> section of a project like this:
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <variables>
 * 	<variable name="myVariable">myValue</variable>
 * </variables>
 * }
 * </pre> 
 * <br>
 * A variable is referenced from XML by ${myVariable}. Each variable can be set in a specific context either by redeclaring it in a {@link com.jedox.etl.core.job.IJob job} or externally via the client interface on {@link com.jedox.etl.core.execution.IExecutor execution} runtime.
 * A variable can be both used in an attribute value or in the context of elements. Variables are especially useful if you want to be able to change the behavior of your project in a single point, instead of doing a copy, search, replace approach.   
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The basic data-structure provided by all configurators is a Properties object, which gives access to key-value pairs.
 * Any configurator may implement additional methods to expose more complex data-structures to a component. 
 * </p>
