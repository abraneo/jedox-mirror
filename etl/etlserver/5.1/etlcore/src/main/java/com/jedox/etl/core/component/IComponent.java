/**
 * ETL-Server follows an extensible component architecture.
 * This interface defines all abstract functionality common to all components.  
 * <p>
 * A component has to registered in a component registry held by the {@link ComponentFactory}, which is responsible for instantiating all components.
 * Components may be created for all types defined in {@link ITypes.Components}. Each component type correspond to an interface this component has to mandatory implement when registered in this scope.
 * Generally components may decide to implement more than one such interface. In this case they may be registered in multiple scopes. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The counterpart to the component concept is the {@link IManager manager} concept, which may hold and manage multiple components of the same type.
 * Components in turn may register multiple managers, each one for a particular type of sub-components.
 * The registration of external dependent sub-components in managers is required to support the correct calculation of dependencies necessary for component {@link com.jedox.etl.core.execution.IExecutor execution}. 
 * Only sub-components, which are strictly local to this component and thus only are used by this component may omitted from manager registration. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All components configure themselves in the {@link #init() initialization} phase with the help of {@link IConfigurator configurators}, which translate the component mark-up (XML) to suitable internal data-structures.  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All components are {@link ILocatable} locatable via their {@link Locator locators}. Requesting a component from the {@link com.jedox.etl.core.config.ConfigManager} is the recommended way of localizing components, since the ConfigManager always fetches a fresh non-dirty instance. 
 * A component is considered dirty, when the configuration of the component itself or the configuration of any registered sub-component has changed. Additionally components may be set dirty by application logic to enforce a new generation after some special operations.    
 * </p>    
 * <p>
 * The component life-cycle includes four distinct phases:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Creation phase: the implementing class is determined and instantiated. The configurator class is initialized</li>
 *  <li>Configuration phase: the configurator class tries to configure itself accordingly to the xml description</li>
 *  <li>Initialization phase: the component tries to initialize itself with the data structures produced by the configurator</li>
 *  <li>Runtime phase: the component gets in action and extracts / transforms / loads data</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
